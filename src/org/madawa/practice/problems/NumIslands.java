Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and
is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all
surrounded by water.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
